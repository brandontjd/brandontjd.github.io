          <p>
            I'm a Year 2 student at Singapore Management University, pursuing a
            double degree in Business Management and Information Systems. My
            majors are in Quantitative Finance and Business Analytics. I've had
            the opportunity to intern at fast growing consumer internet
            companies such as Foodpanda and Klook. There, I've gained insights
            into the applications of machine learning to boost profit margins
            and spearheaded successful projects myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I've decided to pursue a career in Quantitative Finance (QF),
            specifically, in applying machine learning techniques to manage risk
            and uncover alpha factors. I'm currently interning at 8BIT as a
            Quantitative Developer leveraging serverless technologies and
            identifying potential actionable research papers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also the current president of SMU QF Society (QED). I hope to
            be able to foster an sense of belonging amongst all QF students by
            the end of my term. Should you have any interest in collaborating,
            do shoot me an email and I'd be more than happy to explore potential
            partnerships.

            "Backtesting can never be a true positive, it can only flag out
            false positives." - Marcos Lopez.

          <p>
            All too often, financial research papers have been perverted by
            p-hacking and false backtesting. Hence, on this journey that I'm on,
            I'm determined to use Machine Learning responsibly. It will not only
            be used to generate alpha but also as a tool to uncover financial
            theorems that can provide a true positive, one that is not backed
            solely by backtesting.
